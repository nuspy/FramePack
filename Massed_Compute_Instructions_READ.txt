Put everything into a folder in like desktop or downloads

Make folder name like video_ai - don't use space chacters or special characters in folder paths ever

Open a terminal in the folder where you did put the files

To install run below command

chmod +x Massed_Compute_Install.sh
./Massed_Compute_Install.sh

To use after install

Open a new terminal in the folder where you downloaded files and executed

If you model downloads fail close CMD and try again beacuse we use fast download with HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER=1
